# 2048 Without Merging
This is a fork of
[gabrielecirculli's famous 2048 game](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)
to illustrate the motivation in our paper &ldquo;2048 Without Merging&rdquo;.

There are two tweaks:
* no randomly added tiles
* a forced initial configuration with only two mergable tiles: two 1024s
